If all you can think about Monday morning is how quickly your weekend flew by, you might want to consider expanding your horizons a bit in the future. Turns out, the key to a fulfilling weekend that doesn’t feel too short is to seek out “newness.”

According to *David Eagleman*, professor at Stanford University and the author of **The Brain: The Story of You**, **pursuing new settings, new activities, and new experiences is the best way to “stretch time,”** so to speak. It all comes down to what your brain perceives as novel. When you spend time doing something unfamiliar, your brain focuses more on collecting the data associated with the activity, thus creating a more thorough memory of the experience. When you reflect on that memory, it feels like you had more time.

> so to speak: 可以说

The reverse is true as well. If you do the same routine every weekend, you won’t remember much about your days off come Monday morning. It will feel like they flew by because you weren’t giving your brain new data to collect and incorporate. **Eagleman points out that a routine weekend is similar to a really long, uneventful flight; it seems endless while you’re actually in the air, but once you land you practically forget about the entire experience.** It’s the same reason why time seems to go by faster as you get older, explains Eagleman:

> “When you’re a kid, everything is novel and you’re laying down new memories about it. So when you look back at the end of a childhood summer, it seems to have taken a long time because you remember this and that, this new thing, learning that, experiencing that. But when you’re older, you’ve sort of seen all the patterns before.”

Fortunately, seeking out newness every weekend isn’t as difficult as it sounds—you don’t need to go skydiving or anything like that. You just need to make some plans that exist outside of your normal routine.

You can:

* Go on a weekend getaway.

> getaway: a getaway is a short holiday somewhere. 短期休假

* Go for a hike somewhere off your beaten path

> hike: a hike is a long walk in the country, especially one that you go on for pleasure. 远足
> beaten path: 常走的路

* Try a new restaurant or bar
* Explore a neighborhood you haven’t spent much time in
* Go for a long bike ride on the beach
* Browse a bookstore or antique shop you’ve always wondered about
* Go to a flea market or farmers market on the other side of town
* See a play instead of a movie.

A new setting can be just as effective as well. Last weekend I took my Kindle and Nintendo Switch to the park, just for a change of environment. I was still doing exactly what I was going to do at home, but it felt fresh and really made my weekend seem longer in the end.

> setting: a particular setting is a particular place or type of surroundings where something is or takes place. （事件发生的）背景；地点

Experiencing more new things doesn’t make time slow down in the present, however. If anything, doing new stuff makes time feel like it’s going by faster while you do it. But it’s a price you’ll have to pay if you want to start your week off feeling like you made the most of your free time. So, do you want your weekend time to flow slowly as you go about your same ol’ routine, or do you want to look back at your weekend fulfilled, marveling at all the new stuff you did in such a seemingly short amount of time? There’s no right answer, but the choice is yours.

> if anything: 如果有什么区别的话
> marvel: if you marvel at something, you express your great surprise, wonder, or admiration. 大为赞叹
> start off: if you start off by doing something, you do it as the first part of an activity.

Don’t sleep in. As a matter of fact, I get up even earlier than when I usually do for work. Then your weekend doesn’t just seem longer, it is longer. Plus, don’t do the usual stuff on weekends, stuff like grocery shopping, cutting the grass, you know, chores. It’s so mundane and robot like. Go to stores (not grocery), museums, ethnic neighborhoods for lunch or dinner, to the zoo, get laid or just go for a ride. It doesn’t have to be anything extravagant. No matter where you live, there’s something to do every weekend. 

> grocery: a grocery or a grocery store is a small shop that sells foods such as flour, sugar, and canned goods. 食品杂货店
> chore: a chore is a task that you must do but that you find unpleasant or boring. 琐事
> mundane: something that is mundane is very ordinary and not at all interesting or unusual. 平凡的；单调的
> ethnic neighborhood: 民族聚居地
> get laid: have sexual intercourse with 与某人发生关系
> extravagant: something that is extravagant costs more money than you can afford or uses more of something than is necessary. 

> hit the nail on the head: 一针见血

Seconded. One of the first positive turns I made after a bad breakup was realizing how much of my weekend was being sapped by my partner’s sleeping in (and weekly family gatherings). Not gonna lie, it took some time to figure out what to do with a weekend effectively doubled in length.
